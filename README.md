## SEMI-AUTONOMOUS FORKLIFT 

This project implements a semi-autonomous forklift system leveraging the power of ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) for robust communication and integration. The forklift can be controlled with a joystick(gamepad) for manual operation and utilizes navigation capabilities for autonomous tasks. It employs SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) to build a map of the environment and localize itself within it, ensuring safe and efficient navigation. Additionally, OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is integrated for color-based object detection, enabling the forklift to identify and handle specific boxes.
